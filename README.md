# Some-Random-Stuff
Here is where you can see some random stuff I tried that might be interesting
# Stuff Added so Far
<li>A golf application demo. Takes mouse input to launch a ball around the frame and when it hits the hole it falls in it.</li>
<br/>
<li>Projectile range visualizer made in processing. Takes in values of velocity, angle, initial height, and initial distance to show a simple simulation and outs range and max height once the projectile lands.</li>
<br/>
<li>A variation on Conway's Game of Life to generate semi-realistic land-water terrain. A change in rules from the original to prefer clumping of cells. Also kinda looks like coral.</li>
<br/>
<li>Program generating Fibonacci terms based on user input. Uses BigInteger to allow for much larger terms than long.</li>
<br/>
<li>A new variation of Pong where there are 4 paddles, along with special conditions that happen every interval</li>
