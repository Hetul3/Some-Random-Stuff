# Stuff Added so Far
A golf application demo. Takes mouse input to launch a ball around the frame and when it hits the hole it falls in it.

Projectile range visualizer made in processing. Takes in values of velocity, angle, initial height, and initial distance to show a simple simulation and outs range and max height once the projectile lands.

A variation on Conway's Game of Life to generate semi-realistic land-water terrain. A change in rules from the original to prefer clumping of cells. Also kinda looks like coral.
